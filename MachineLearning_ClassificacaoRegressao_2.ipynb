de cobertura de solo urbano.\n","\n","Dataset contendo dados de treino e teste para uso academico de algorítimos de Machine Learning no intuito de classificar cobertura de solo urbano a partir de dados obitidos em imagem de alta resolução.\n","\n","Informações espectrais em várias escalas, tamanhos, forma e textura.\n","\n","Há um baixo numero de amostras de treinamento para cada classe (14 - 30) e um alto número de variáveis de classificação (148) sendo assim um ótimo conjunto de dados para testar métodos de seleção de recursos.\n","\n","# Objetivo\n","\n","Este projeto tem como objetivo aplicar algoritmos de machine learning para classificação e predição de coberturas de solo a partir de imagem: árvores, grama, solo, concreto, asfalto, edifícios, carros, piscinas e sombras.\n","\n","# Especificação Técnica\n","\n","Dataset: Para desenvolvimento desse projeto, será utilizado o dataset encontrado no sítio (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) denominado Urban Land Cover Data set, disponível em: <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00295/>.\n","\n","Formato: A base de dados está em formato CSV, estando divivida em dois domínios (testing.csv e training.csv), colunas classe(ou categoria), dados numéricos e texto.\n","\n","Métodos de Pŕe-processamento: Necessário importar dataset no AWS Glue Studio para avaliação dos dados e utilização de ferramentas de transformação quando for o caso.\n","\n","Algoritmos Avaliados: Serão avaliados os algoritmos de Classificação, Regressão Logística utilizando método supervisionado.\n","\n","#
